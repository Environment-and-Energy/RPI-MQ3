## to do

- we need to set a constant distance that the rover will need to travel for demo day, then measure how long it takes to travel that distance (measure approx 5 times to get average time)

- the time it takes to travel the line will be how long we set the sensor to measure.....then we can subtract the max reading index seconds from the total and get the glug rover to travel backwards for the total of that value. 

- add led to show concentration amounts

- figure out how we going to apply filter or ML/AI
